tftp-elixir
======

A thin layer of Elixir poured atop tftp-hpa.

### To use:

Add this repository as a dependency to your mix.exs, run ``mix do deps.get deps.compile``, and then
```
iex> TFTP.get "theirfile", "theirtftpserver"
:ok
iex> TFTP.put "myfile", "theirtftpserver"
:ok
```

For now, this assumes you (1) have a tftp client installed, (2) can execute said tftp client by entering ``tftp`` at a shell prompt, and (3) can pass arguments ``-m`` (for transfer mode) and ``-c`` (for command) to it.
